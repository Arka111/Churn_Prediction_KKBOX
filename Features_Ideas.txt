1) Regenerate activities based on weekends and weekdays in addition to total or sum.
That will double the number of num_X and cumu_x
(Keep in mind I'm only considering the past 6 months, well 5 months because you don't count activity
of the month you're making prediction, but I have up to 26 months)

2) Add percentage of unique songs played for each month (cumu100 is the total number of songs played)

3) Can have boolean like did user change of plan in the past month? 2 months? 3 months?

4) For song count per month, most of the time, if it is zero it means user didn't have a membership.
It doesn't mean he wasn't active. Is that a problem? If yes, how to tackle it.

5) Take into account holidays! (external data). There is always a drop during chinese new year.
