1) Regenerate activities based on weekends and weekdays in addition to total or sum.
That will double the number of num_X and cum_x
(Keep in mind I'm only considering the past 6 months, well 5 months because you don't count activity
of the month you're making prediction, but I have up to 26 months)

2) Add percentage of unique songs played for each month (cum_100 is the total number of songs played)

3) Can have boolean like did user change of plan in the past month? 2 months? 3 months?

4) For song count per month, most of the time, if it is zero it means user didn't have a membership.
It doesn't mean he wasn't active. Is that a problem? yes. We could have a boolean saying does this user
have a membership for each month.
Song count should be normalized by number of days user had a membership during that month.

5) Take into account holidays! (external data). There is always a drop during chinese new year.
